        Find the lexicographically largest suffix of the string.

        This uses a clever two-pointer technique:
        - We maintain two candidates for the best suffix starting at positions 'left' and 'right'
        - We compare these suffixes character by character
        - When we find a difference, we keep the better one and move the pointers optimally

        Key insight: If we're comparing suffixes starting at positions i and j,
        and they match for k characters, then if s[i+k] < s[j+k], we know that
        suffix starting at j is better. But we can also eliminate all positions
        between i and i+k as potential candidates because they would all be worse than j.

        Find the lexicographically largest string that can appear in any valid split.

        Strategy:
        1. If numFriends == 1, we take the entire word as one part

        3. Truncate this suffix to the maximum allowed length for a single part

        Why this works:
        - The lexicographically largest suffix gives us the best possible starting point
        - We can only take at most (n - numFriends + 1) characters for our part
